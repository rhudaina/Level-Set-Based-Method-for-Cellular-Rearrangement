# Level Set-Based Method for Cellular Rearrangement [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/rhudaina/Level-Set-Based-Method-for-Cellular-Rearrangement/blob/main/LICENSE)

This source code executes our proposed level set-based algorithm for realizing cellular rearrangements in various tissue morphological phenomena, e.g., total engulfment, cellular patterning in olfactory and auditory sensory tissues, cell sorting, and 3D cell internalization.

## Installation ##

Clone the repository
 
    git clone https://github.com/rhudaina/Level-Set-Based-Method-for-Cellular-Rearrangement.git

or download zip and unzip the repository into a directory of your choice.

### Dependencies ###

This source code was created with and requires the following.
* [GNU gcc compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html)
* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/download.html)
* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html)


## Getting Started ##

Open a terminal window, access subfolder `/code`, and execute the following commands.
```
bash run.sh
```
The resulting movie `simulation.mp4` should be saved explicitly to subfolder `/results`.
If the said movie file does not exist, run the following script within MATLAB.
```
generate_result.m
```
 That's it.

### Parameters ###

* `$Dimension` 
* Frequency Change: `mydata = Quandl.get('NSE/OIL", 'collapse','annual');` ("weekly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"annual")
* Transformations: `mydata: = Quandl.get('NSE/OIL','transformation','rdiff');` ("diff"|"rdiff"|"normalize"|"cumulative")
* Return only n number of rows: `mydata = Quandl.get('NSE/OIL','rows',5);`
